![](media/image17.jpeg)

In addition to the same **Search**, **Send feedback**, and **Sign in**
controls

that are available on the **Home** page, the **Data Catalog** page

provides additional controls to locate and load data.

The first of these are presented as a set of links dubbed **Popular
Tags**.

Each opens a listing of dataset names, descriptions,

and links that are much like those that are also listed here.

A click on any of the dataset names will open a new page offering

\- a fuller description of the dataset, and

This page will also include

THE **WORKSPACE PAGE**

At the heart of the Google Earth Engine GUI is the **Workspace** page,
which controls the ability to locate, load, display, describe, and
compute geographical datasets.

Beyond a set of **Search**, **Send feedback**, and **Sign in** controls
like those on the **Home** and **Data Catalog** pages, the **Workspace**
page offers additional controls of

**[CONTROLS](#_top)** ON THE **DISPLAY SCREEN** OF THE [WORKSPACE
PAGE](#WorkspacePage)

![](media/image24.jpeg)The **Display Screen** on the **Workspace** page
operates much like the widely used **Google Maps** application. It will
initially depict a portion of the Earth by way of either topographic
base map or a satellite image according to whichever of these buttons in
its upper-right corner has most recently been clicked.

![](media/image25.jpeg)![](media/image26.jpeg)

![](media/image27.jpeg)![](media/image28.jpeg)By hovering over the
**Map** button and check-marking **Terrain**, By hovering over the
**Satellite** button and check-marking **Labels**,

you can add topographic relief shading to the base map. you can add
labels to the satellite image.

**[CONTROLS](#_top)** <span id="ControlPanel" class="anchor"></span>ON
THE **CONTROL PANEL** OF THE [WORKSPACE PAGE](#WorkspacePage)

![](media/image32.jpeg)

Just as the **Workspace** page is the most active part of the EE GUI,

its **Control Panel** is the most active part of the **Workspace** page.

The controls offered here enable a user to

\- load and unload data to be processed,

\- indicate those data are to be displayed, and

\- specify computations to be performed using those data.

The **Control Panel** may include as many as three sections:

\- a **Data** section that will always appear at its top,

\- **Classes** section that may appear below that,

depending on the data that have been loaded, and

\- an **Analysis** section will appear below that

appear only for more specialized purposes.

That **Analysis** section offers several special-purpose controls

for the classification of satellite imagery

The **Data** section is of much more general use. It offers both

![](media/image33.jpeg)an **Add Data** button and a **+** button

> to load data by activating the
> 
> **Workspace** page’s **Search Bar**.

![](media/image34.jpeg) Once loaded, each dataset is added to the top of
a list like

> this where it is referred to as a “**layer**.” Every layer listed
> 
> here is also displayed on the **Display Screen** unless one of
> 
> these buttons is used to render it invisible.
>

> 
> on the **Display Screen** will be the order in which they
> 
> appear in the list. To change this order, just click on the
> 
> far left end of any layer’s list entry and drag it up or down.

This **Add computation** button can also be used to add layers

to the **Workspace** page. Here, however, the layers being

> added are not being read from stored datasets *per se* but are
> 
> being computed with this set of geospatial functions.

The concept of a “computed later” (part noun and part verb) is one the
things that fundamentally distinguishes EE from a conventional GIS.

Rather than store newly computed data, EE more often just stores the
computations necessary to generate such data.

**[CONTROLS](#_top)** IN THE **CLASSES SECTION** ON THE [CONTROL
PANEL](#ControlPanel) OF THE [WORKSPACE PAGE](#WorkspacePage)

The **Classes** section of the **Control Panel** provides for the
management of what are called “classes.” Each is a specified color and
name that can be used to represent any of the values on one or more
“classified raster” layers. A classified raster is one whose values
represent distinct qualities (such as types of land cover) rather than
continuous quantities (such as topographic elevations).

For example, a class whose name is given as “Water” and whose color is
set to a particular shade of blue might be assigned to whatever values
represents water bodies on one layer entitled “Landcover” and another
entitled “Soils.” Significantly, pixels with values for which no class
has been designated will always appear as transparent on the **Display
Screen**.

The Classes section will appear

in the Control Panel only when

at least one classified raster layer

is present in the Workspace.

Whenever the Classes section

disappears (for lack of such a layer)

and then reappears (when one is

later added), however, its most

recent state will be restored.

The Classes section will appear
